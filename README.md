# ## Art Supply Shop Wordpress Theme

Super simple Wordpress theme for an art supply store. Are we allowed to say which one? It's a homework project, not a commercial project. It's for Wellington's very own [French Art Shop](https://thefrenchartshop.co.nz/).

### Installation
To install this project you'll need to run the following terminal commands:
```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/andybaaall/news-API-project
    $ cd news-API-project
    $ npm install
```

You'll also need to move the project folder into your [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/download/) website's themes folder. The themes folder lives at: YOUR_WEBSITE/wp-content/themes/
